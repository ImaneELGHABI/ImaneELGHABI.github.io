    <section class="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a data scientist with a strong passion for machine learning, AI, and decentralized systems. My experiences span various industries, from developing data extraction tools to advancing voice synthesis, and contributing to environmental sustainability through intelligent systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am preparing for a PhD at the University of Amsterdam, where I will research event-based communication algorithms for decentralized digital twins in intelligent wastewater treatment systems, under the supervision of Dr. Victoria Degeler. This research is part of the NWO Merian Fund's "DDTclean" project, aiming to enhance sustainability through AI, sensor data, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            With expertise in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn), I am excited to contribute to the intersection of data science, AI, and sustainable technologies.
